The OSM map studied in the project is mainly of Hong Kong with a little bit of Shenzhen, China.

I pick this area because it is my home. Shenzhen is included because there is no way to export precisely along the borders of Hong Kong.
It's a metropolis with a population of ~ 7 million. Densly populated, busy, noisy. Not much of agriculture to speak of but quite some rural areas because of town planning.
